   July 11 Reflection: The main similarities betwen Scratch and Python are in concepts like loops and printing strings to 
   get user input. When regarding syntax they are very different. Scratch uses blocks while Python uses text to create programs.
   This means that Python is more complicated but also more powerful. I found that debugging was annoying but satisfyiatng. It was helpful
   that the debugger told you what line the error was on but it was sometimes hard to figure out what was wrong in the certain line of code.

    July 17:
    Today we built series and parallel circuits using breadbox and LED lights. It was extremely helpful that I had prior knowledge of circuits due to my endurance of AP Physics 1.
    It was a challenge at first to create a parallel circuit because the breadbox was small and a literal parallel circuit is much more complex
    than a drawing of one. We ultimately failed making a piezo work but succeeded in all the other challenges. I think that our issue with the piezo was that the arduino didn't power the row with the piezo

   July 17 Reflection: My ideas surrounding robots have not changed today. I know that robots can range from really simply machines like
   ours to self-sufficient AI like those in self-driving cars. I am excited to see a future where remedial tasks can be automated and life quality
   will increase. I am nervous for a world where so much is accessible that hacking can cause extreme damage. The idea of someone hacking into a car or pacemaker
   is terrifying and I hope adequate security is adding to emerging technologies. Regarding group work, I think we worked well through our problems
   but could be more inclusive and share responcibilities more equally. I think that I must be outgoing in trying to explain everything while I hope that other group
   members show more focus and drive to participate.

    July 24 Reflection: I learned that the internet is a network of cables that connect people and the world wide web is only a part of the internet.
    LaTex would be a markup language because it tells computers how something should look not what to do like a programming language.
