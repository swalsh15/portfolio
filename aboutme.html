   July 11 Reflection: The main similarities betwen Scratch and Python are in concepts like loops and printing strings to 
   get user input. When regarding syntax they are very different. Scratch uses blocks while Python uses text to create programs.
   This means that Python is more complicated but also more powerful. I found that debugging was annoying but satisfyiatng. It was helpful
   that the debugger told you what line the error was on but it was sometimes hard to figure out what was wrong in the certain line of code.

    Today we built series and parallel circuits using breadbox and LED lights. It was extremely helpful that I had prior knowlede of circuits due to my endurance of AP Physics 1.
